#  Rock Paper Scissors CMST-II

Overall, I feel pretty average in my understanding of integrating node.js into the R.P.S. Project. There was times where I felt I could add in addition to what the class was working on together, but everytime I tried to add a new feature I seem to break the program. The biggest challenge for me was catching up with all the changes we made into the Rock Paper Scissor program. On what I struggled, I actually enjoyed debugging alot of the syntax errors.
